<h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">Hi! I'm  Subhajit</h1>

I'm a freelance machine learning engineer based in the United Kingdom with 3+ years of experience building data automation workflows, interactive dashboards, and machine learning systems across finance, e-commerce, and data-driven research.


I help businesses turn unstructured data - PDFs, scanned documents, and messy reports - into searchable knowledge bases using OCR, NLP, and LLMs. From RAG-powered chatbots to interactive dashboards, I build end-to-end AI systems that simplify search, insight, and automation.


I've had quite the journey - from diving deep into quantum research to building indie projects and taking on freelance work in finance and e-commerce. When it comes to machine learning, I don't just build prototypes that look good on paper. I'm all about creating real, production-ready systems that actually work in the wild. My go-to tools? Python, Streamlit, LangChain, and AWS - they help me deliver solutions that are both fast and rock-solid.


Outside work, I'm into code experiments, trading, and reading books. If you're looking for someone who blends deep tech with business impact - I'd love to hear from you.
